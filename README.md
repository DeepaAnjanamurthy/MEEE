## MEEE
MEEE is a full stack application, designed for short, medium length meditation tracks for new and experienced *chakra* meditators. The app will focus on the 7 main *chakras*, and play meditation tracks from YouTube on a video player within the app. It also helps meditators record their experience after each session and view their meditation progress.

## Motivation
As a requirement for the completion of Web Dev dimploma at BrainStation, I had to create a project within a short span of 2 weeks to demonstrate understanding of course content. Having been a meditator for over a decade, I decided to meditate on it and *voila*... this idea popped!! I decided to bring to life a glimpse of a technique that I use as part of my self-discovery journey and what I wished was out there for other meditators along their journeys.
